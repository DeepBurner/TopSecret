# TopSecret(Tentative)

TopSecret is a learning and collaboration tool. It is a website in which you can find learning sources pertaining to any subject, maintained by the community. Think of it like Wikipedia but for specifically learning the subject. It is also a communication platform that brings together everyone who is interested in the said subject. It also encompasses a collaboration tool based on git that advanced practitioners of any given topic can use to find and collaborate with other advanced people interested in research. Think of it like GitHub, but for research.

TopSecret is written using PHP Laravel web framework.
